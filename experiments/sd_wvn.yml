    # - Each item in the list specifies a hit multiplier and a block
    #   pattern. 
    # - '1' indicates a block cell, '0' indicates empty space. 
    # - The blocks fall toward the animat from the top of the environment to
    #   the bottom.
    # - Each block pattern is presented in each possible initial position
    #   twice: once falling to the left (shifting one cell down and one cell
    #   left), and once falling to the right (shifting one cell down and one
    #   cell right).
    # - If the animat overlaps with a block cell at the bottom, the trial is
    #   counted as a 'hit'. 
    # - The hit multiplier is added to the animat's score if there was a
    #   hit, and subtracted if there wasn't.
